# Traffic Light

Group project of logic circuits course

My teammate for this project was lovely [Negin](https://github.com/nderakhshan).

In this project, we had to simulate and implement a traffic light at a crossroads, which has the following features:<br />
* The duration of crossing four roads for each side of the light is 20 seconds.<br />
* Each side of the four roads must have 3 LEDs in green, yellow, and red colors and 2  7-segments which show the waiting time.<br />
 
Extra Points For:
 * Creating the ability to manually control the lights by the police and display the PO symbol on all segment 7s.
